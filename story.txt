Once upon a time, there was a kid who accidently slept through every single exam. Unfortunately for him, he was on
the verge of failing out of college, so he had to interact with each professor and explain why he was unconscious.

This kid was none other than the infamous Eric Zhou. Also unfortunately for him, he had crippling social anxiety.
What was Eric to do? Do the hard (but right) thing and talk to his professor, or be his good old normal self and flunk out?
(Franklin)
He decided that it was the right thing to do. So one day, he decided to put on his best suit and tie, pack up his bags, and
then go out to his professors' offices. He first started with Franklin Wang, the professor that automatically failed him 
not because he slept in, but because out of spite.
(eric)
Eric found that Franklin failed him because he has failed many courses before. Franklin thought he was not prepared for campus
life and need to practice more in high school. How could Eric convince Franklin?
(Pintao)
So Eric spent months getting tuitions from WhiteHat Jr and made an app using CoderZ which revolutionized the world in its entirety.
What could Franklin do... except bow down before Eric The Almighty?
