Once upon a time, there was a kid who accidently slept through every single exam. Unfortunately for him, he was on
the verge of failing out of college, so he had to interact with each professor and explain why he was unconscious.

This kid was none other than the infamous Eric Zhou. Also unfortunately for him, he had crippling social anxiety.
What was Eric to do? Do the hard (but right) thing and talk to his professor, or be his good old normal self and flunk out?
